# Second-Task-from-Nexus-Info.1
Used AutoGluon (provided by Amazon) to implement AutoML for solving a disease prediction problem statement as provided by Nexus.

Supported hyperparameter documentation: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/autogluon-tabular-hyperparameters.html

Supported AutoGluon documentation for prediction on tabular data: https://auto.gluon.ai/stable/tutorials/tabular/tabular-quick-start.html


(Conclusion: The notebook in this repository demonstrates the successful implementation of AutoML in the prediction of 'disease' on tabular data.)

(Disclaimer: It's advised to change the value of train test split, each time you use the code, to avoid any unwanted errors...)
Thank You!
